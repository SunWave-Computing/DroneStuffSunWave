# DroneStuffSunWave

This is our README file for the DroneStuffSunWave repository for class. I couldn't set this repo to private because we don't pay for a subscription, so it is public.

09/05/19 - Updated README, our DEV team is doing an excellent job! Great work guys! I've spoken with the CEO and he is very hahppy with the progress we've been making with our programming. I had a meeting with legal today and they've given us the stamp on our software so far. Good work team!
